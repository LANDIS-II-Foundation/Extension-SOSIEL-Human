Integration 1.0.6.6374 2017-06-13

New features:
 - Changed output format for 'activated rule values' column (removed parameter name).
 - Changed algorithm: FE agents work with site biomass instead of average site biomass.  
 - Changed configuration: antecedent parameter of FE is Biomass


Integration 1.0.5.6363 2017-06-02

New features:
 - Changed anticipatory learning and action selection algorithms.
 - Added activated rule values and total number of rules to the output model.

 Fixed bugs:
 - Fixed the bug in algorithm for checking the possibility of collective action.

Integration 1.0.4.6361 2017-05-31

New features:
 - Changed the formula of normalized difference (Normalized difference = |actual difference / max difference|).
 - Added algorithm of generating new ai values for the new rule.


Integration 1.0.3.6360 2017-05-30

New features:
 - Biomass reduction moved to the SOSIEL algorithm for avoiding biomass reduction differences.


Integration 1.0.2.6359 2017-05-29

New features:
 - Implemented the rule equality checking for avoiding creating a lot of similar rules.
 - Implemented additional cases to calculate normalized difference in goal prioritization method.
