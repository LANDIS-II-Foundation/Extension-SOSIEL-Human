Evaluation 1.0.15.6314 2017-04-14

New features:
 - M10-M11. An agent can learn from others if they are confident in the goal that is the agents critical during that iteration
 - M8-M11. Added variable Mean and StdDeviation for configuring normal distribution.
 - M7. Added second agent configuration file for simulating tit-for-tat vs tit-for-tat
 - M8-M11. Removed param MaxGoalValue and changed logic for using Focal value instead of MaxGoalValue.
 - M10. Modyfied AL (in case Maximize). If diffCurAndFocal >= 0 then (confidence = yes and direction = stand) else (confidence = no and direction = up). Before the change the confidence was only YES if diffCurAndFocal == 0.


Evaluation 1.0.14.6313 2017-04-13

New features:
 - M8-M11. Changed algorithm for generating goal importance. Uniform distribution random changed to normal distribution
 - M9-M10. Added agent subtype (initiator/other) to node_initial.csv
 - M9-M10. Agent "initiator" is not in the center/top hierarchy now. Assigned randomly.
 - M5. Removed punishment.

 Fixed bugs:
 - Fixed removing rule from mental model. 



Evaluation 1.0.13.6312 2017-04-12

New features:
 - M11. Adaptive cycle statistic is collecting at the end of each iteration after deactivation but before reproduction now
 - M5-M6. Create new output "initial_agent_variables.csv" which contains agent Id, agent_c, agent_p for each agent.

Fixed bugs:
 - M1-M6, M11. Retrieve node/edge initial and final
